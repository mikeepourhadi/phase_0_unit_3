## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add

#### branch

can take a series of arguments - manipulates branches in your local repo (create, delete, list, etc)

#### fetch
<!-- Your defnition here -->

#### merge

#### push

## Release 3: Git Workflow

- Push files to a remote repository
	
	git status
	git commit
	git push

- Fetch changes

	git fetch
	// if changes are desired
	git pull

- Commit locally

	git status
	git add // periodically
	git commit -m // with message

Reflection:

Git has become fairly easy for me to use - at least the app. I'm not too comfortable with the command line functions, and I get the feeling that we will mostly be using the command line. I wish I had been using the command line this whole time, honestly, but I will adjust. I imagine it will become second nature after just a few weeks of use - at least hopefully!
